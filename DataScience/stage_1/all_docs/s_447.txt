<person>Serena</person> ends <person>Sania Mirza</person>'s dream

<person>Sania Mirza</person>, the first Indian woman to reach the third round of a Grand Slam tennis event, has lost to women's favourite <person>Serena Williams</person>.

The 18-year-old Mirza, who got a wild card entry into the Australian Open in Melbourne, lost to <person>Williams</person> 1-6,4-6 in the third round. <person>Williams</person> took just 56 minutes to defeat <person>Mirza</person> and sail into the fourth round. The only other Indian woman to win a match at a Grand Slam is <person>Nirupama Vaidyanathan</person>. <person>Vaidyanathan</person> made it to the second round of the Australian Open in 1998.

Playing the biggest match of her life, <person>Mirza</person> made little impact on <person>Williams</person> in the early stages of the game. But the teenager showed more confidence in the second set and engaged the seventh-seeded <person>Williams</person> in some well contested rallies. <person>Mirza</person>, a junior Wimbledon doubles title winner, became the first Indian woman to reach the third round of a grand slam tennis event when she beat Hungarian <person>Petra Mandula</person> on Wednesday. "I'm really excited. I was confident but I didn't think it was going to be that easy," <person>Mirza</person> said after her second round win. "My aim was to win a round here. When I did that I was so relieved, there was no pressure." Tennis is not a particularly popular sport in India, but a number of Indians watched the live telecast of the match between <person>Mirza</person> and <person>Williams</person>. <person>Mirza</person>, who lives in the southern Indian city of Hyderabad known for producing a host of top Indian cricketers, turned professional two years ago. She says she was considered too small when she went for her first tennis classes as a six-year-old girl. "Then finally [the coach] called my parents up and said 'the way she hits the ball, I've never seen a six-year-old hit a ball like that'," <person>Mirza</person> told the Associated Press.
