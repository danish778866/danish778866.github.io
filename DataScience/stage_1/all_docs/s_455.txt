Slovakia clinched the Hopman Cup for the second time by beating Argentina 3-0 in Saturday's final in Perth.

<person>Daniela Hantuchova</person> put the third seeds ahead, recovering from a terrible start to beat <person>Gisela Dulko</person> 1-6 6-4 6-4. <person>Dominik Hrbaty</person>, who had not lost a set in his three singles matches in the group stages, then upset world number seven <person>Guillermo Coria</person> 6-4 6-1. <person>Hantuchova</person> and <person>Hrbaty</person> then won the mixed doubles after <person>Coria</person> was forced to withdraw because of a sore back. Slovakia's win made up for last year's final defeat to the United States. "I would like to congratulate <person>Daniela</person>," <person>Hrbaty</person> said. "I was so nervous watching her today, I almost had a heart attack. "I also feel a little sorry for <person>Guillermo</person> because I get very excited whenever I play for my country. I show lots of emotions and played such good tennis."

World number 31 <person>Hantuchova</person>, ranked two places above <person>Dulko</person>, looked nervous as she dropped the first four games of the match. <person>Dulko</person>, who had lost all three of her singles matches in the group stages, grew in confidence and took the opening set in just 27 minutes. But <person>Hantuchova</person> hit back to take the next two and the match. "I was so nervous because I really wanted to win for the team and for <person>Dominik</person> as he played so well all week," she said. "I didn't think I was playing my best but I just tried to hang in there and fight hard for every point for my country." Slovakia won the Cup on their first appearance in 1998 when <person>Karol Kucera</person> and <person>Karina Habsudova</person> beat France.
