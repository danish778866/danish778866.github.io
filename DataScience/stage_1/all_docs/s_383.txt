<person>Dawson</person> wins England squad recall

Wasps scrum-half <person>Matt Dawson</person> has been recalled to England's training squad ahead of the RBS Six Nations and been reinstated in the Elite Player Squad.

Coach <person>Andy Robinson</person> dropped <person>Dawson</person> for the autumn Tests after he missed training to film 'A Question of Sport.' "I always said I would consider bringing <person>Matt</person> back if I felt he was playing well," <person>Robinson</person> said. "He merits his return on current form." Newcastle's 18-year-old centre <person>Mathew Tait</person> is also in the training squad. "It's obviously an honour to be asked to train with England," said <person>Tait</person>, who has burst into contention recently. "I look forward to going down and doing the sessions, but the most important thing at the moment is Sunday's game against Newport, so I'm not looking any further than that." <person>Robinson</person> has invited 42 players to attend a three-day session in Leeds next week, in which his squad will train in part with the Leeds Rhinos rugby league squad.

With <person>Mike Tindall</person> ruled out of the opening two matches and Will Greenwood sidelined for the entire Six Nations, <person>Tait</person> is one of six or seven contenders for the two centre berths. <person>Stuart Abbott</person>, <person>Jamie Noon</person>, <person>Ollie Smith</person>, <person>Olly Barkley</person> and <person>Henry Paul</person> - who retains his place despite his early substitution against Australia - are also in the mix. <person>Ben Cohen</person> could also be considered after switching from the wing for his club Northampton recently. Prop <person>Phil Vickery</person> and lock <person>Simon Shaw</person> both return to the squad after missing the autumn Tests through injury, while Wasps wing <person>Tom Voyce</person> is recalled. The group also includes Bath flanker <person>Andy Beattie</person> and Leicester hooker <person>George Chuter</person>. "<person>Beattie</person> has matured greatly as a player these past two seasons," <person>Robinson</person> said. <person>Jonny Wilkinson</person>, <person>Tindall</person> and <person>Martin Corry</person> have all been included despite their unavailability for the opening two matches against Wales and France.

The revised 56-man elite squad includes Wasps hooker <person>Phil Greening</person>, who replaces the retired <person>Mark Regan</person>, and Sale wing <person>Mark Cueto</person>. <person>Cueto</person> was selected for the November internationals despite not being part of the group, but scored four tries in three England appearances. Leicester scrum-half <person>Harry Ellis</person> has also been promoted from the senior national academy, and will contest the number nine jersey with <person>Dawson</person> and Gloucester's <person>Andy Gomarsall</person>. The players in <person>Robinson</person>'s elite squad can only play 32 matches for club and country. They can be called up for a total of 16 training days in addition to the recognised international weeks for each of the years leading up to the next World Cup.
