<person>O'Driscoll</person> out of Scotland game

Ireland captain <person>Brian O'Driscoll</person> has been ruled out of Saturday's RBS Six Nations clash against Scotland.

His replacement will be named after training on Friday morning. Fellow centre <person>Gordon D'Arcy</person> is also struggling with a hamstring injury and he will undergo a fitness test on Friday to see if he can play.

<person>Kevin Maggs</person> would be an obvious replacement at centre while <person>Shane Horgan</person> could also be moved from wing. Ulster wing <person>Tommy Bowe</person> could also be asked to travel with the squad to Scotland as a precautionary measure. The only other change to the Ireland side sees Wasps flanker <person>Johnny O'Connor</person> replacing <person>Denis Leamy</person>. <person>O'Connor</person> will be winning his third cap after making his debut in the victory over South Africa last November.
