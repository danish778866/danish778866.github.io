<person>D'Arcy</person> injury adds to Ireland woe

<person>Gordon D'Arcy</person> has been ruled out of the Ireland team for Saturday's Six Nations clash against Scotland in Murrayfield.

Like skipper <person>Brian O'Driscoll</person>, <person>D'Arcy</person> failed to recover from a hamstring injury. The side will now be led by Munster lock <person>Paul O'Connell</person>. <person>Shane Horgan</person> switches from wing to centre where he will be joined by Ulster's <person>Kevin Maggs</person>. <person>Girvan Dempsey</person> comes into the team to take the right wing spot while <person>Gavin Duffy</person> is called up to the replacements. ''We gave <person>Gordon</person> a chance but it didn't work out,'' said Ireland coach <person>Eddie O'Sullivan</person>. ''In terms of the risk element, it was a sensible precaution. He should be fine for the next game but we do not want to tempt fate.''

<person>Maggs</person>, who will win his 67th cap, was the obvious replacement at centre while <person>Shane Horgan</person> was always likely to be moved from the wing. The only other change to the Ireland side from last weekend's win in Rome sees Wasps flanker <person>Johnny O'Connor</person> replacing <person>Denis Leamy</person>. <person>O'Connor</person> will be winning his third cap after making his debut in the victory over South Africa last November.
