<person>Hantuchova</person> in Dubai last eight

<person>Daniela Hantuchova</person> moved into the quarter-finals of the Dubai Open, after beating <person>Elene Likhotseva</person> of Russia 7-5 6-4, and now faces <person>Serena Williams</person>.

Australian Open champion <person>Williams</person> survived an early scare to beat Russia's <person>Elena Bovina</person> 1-6 6-1 6-4. World number one <person>Lindsay Davenport</person> and <person>Anastasia Myskina</person> also progressed. <person>Davenport</person> defeated China's <person>Jie Zheng</person> 6-2 7-5, while French Open champion <person>Myskina</person> sailed through after her opponent <person>Marion Bartoli</person> retired hurt. American <person>Davenport</person> will now face fellow former Wimbledon champion, <person>Conchita Martinez</person> of Spain, who ousted seventh-seeded <person>Nathalie Dechy</person> of France 6-1 6-2. <person>Myskina</person> will face eighth-seed <person>Patty Schnyder</person> from Switzerland, who defeated China's Li Na 6-3 7-6 (10-8). The other quarter final pits wild card <person>Sania Mirza</person> of India against <person>Jelena Jankovic</person> of Serbia and Montenegro, who both won on Tuesday.

Before her meeting with <person>Martinez</person>, <person>Davenport</person> believes there is some room for improvement in her game. "I started well and finished well, but played some so-so games in the middle," she said. <person>Williams</person> was also far from content. "I don't know what I was doing there," she said. "It was really windy and I hadn't played in the wind. All my shots were going out of here." But <person>Hantuchova</person> is in upbeat mood ahead of her clash with the younger Williams sister, who was handed a first-round bye. "I feel I have an advantage over <person>Serena</person> because I have already played two matches on these courts," she said. "It is a difficult court to play on. Very fast and sometimes you feel you have no control over the ball."
