London hope over <person>Chepkemei</person>

London Marathon organisers are hoping that banned athlete <person>Susan
Chepkemei</person> will still take part in this year's race on 17 April.

<person>Chepkemei</person> was suspended from all competition until the end of
the year by Athletics Kenya after failing to report to a national training
camp. "We are watching it closely," said London race director <person>David
Bedford</person>. "There is a long way to go before the race and we are hoping
the situation will be satisfactorily resolved." The camp in Embu was to prepare
for the IAAF World Cross Country Championships later this month.
<person>Chepkemei</person> however took part and finished third in last
Sunday's world best 10K race in Puerto Rico. The 29-year-old has finished
second to <person>Paula Radcliffe</person> in the 2002 and 2003 London races as
well as in November's New York City marathon.
