<person>Dawson</person> joins England injury list

Scrum-half <person>Matt Dawson</person> is an injury doubt for England's Six Nations opener against Wales next weekend.

The World Cup winner missed Wasps' 12-9 loss to Bath on Saturday after injuring his right calf. Wasps coach <person>Warren Gatland</person> said: "He's got a fitness test in the week but he's got a good chance of playing." Gloucester's <person>Andy Hazell</person> and Leicester star <person>Lewis Moody</person> also received knocks during their respective league matches, but should be fit for Wales next week. If <person>Dawson</person> is not fit to face Wales, <person>Robinson</person> will have to choose from Gloucester's <person>Andy Gomarsall</person> or Leicester youngster <person>Harry Ellis</person>.

<person>Jamie Noon</person> is another player on the sidelines after he limped off in the first half against Saracens on Friday with a dead leg. The centre, who is in line for a first Six Nations start against Wales, will have to wait 48 hours before knowing the state of his injury.
