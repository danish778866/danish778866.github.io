MPs demand 'Budget leak' answers

Ministers have been asked to explain how Budget details were printed in a London newspaper half an hour before <person>Gordon Brown</person> made his speech.

The Tories said a large chunk of the Budget appeared to have been leaked in what they describe as a "serious breach of Treasury confidentiality". The Lib Dems called for Commons leader <person>Peter Hain</person> to make a statement and said chancellors had resigned over leaks. They were told it would be brought to Speaker <person>Michael Martin</person>'s attention. In the Commons, Tory frontbencher <person>Andrew Tyrie</person> MP demanded an immediate ministerial statement about how measures had been "clearly, or at least apparently, leaked to the Evening Standard".

Raising a point of order, he said it was "the latest in a long line of discourtesies to this House", as well as a breach of confidentiality. He said: "I can only hope it is unintentional. If it were planned it would be a very grave matter indeed. A previous Labour chancellor resigned after he leaked the Budget." <person>Hugh Dalton</person> resigned after leaking details of his 1947 budget to journalist <person>John Carvel</person>, who published them in a London newspaper, just minutes before they were announced to the House of Commons. Liberal Democrat <person>David Laws</person> said it was a "very serious matter" and said Mr <person>Hain</person> should make a statement on Thursday. Deputy Speaker <person>Sylvia Heal</person> agreed it was "of concern" but said nothing could be done immediately but the issue would be brought to Mr <person>Martin</person>'s attention.
