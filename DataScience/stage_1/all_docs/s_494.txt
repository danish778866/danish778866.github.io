<person>Roche</person> 'turns down Federer offer'

Australian tennis coach <person>Tony Roche</person> has turned down an approach from <person>Roger Federer</person> to be the world number one's new full-time coach, say reports.

Melbourne's Herald-Sun said <person>Roche</person>, troubled by a hip complaint, did not want to travel full-time again. However, <person>Roche</person> is happy to work with the Swiss star on a casual basis and is helping him prepare for next month's defence of his Australian Open crown. <person>Federer</person> has been without a coach since splitting with <person>Peter Lundgren</person> in 2003. <person>Roche</person>, a former Davis Cup player for Australia, won the French Open, reached the Wimbledon and US Open finals and won five Wimbledon doubles titles with <person>John Newcombe</person>.

He also coached former number one <person>Ivan Lendl</person> and <person>Pat Rafter</person> to Grand Slam victories and has worked with Australia's <person>Lleyton Hewitt</person>. Some reports claim Federer initially wanted <person>Andre Agassi</person>'s Australian coach <person>Darren Cahill</person>, before <person>Agassi</person> confirmed he would play on in 2005. <person>Federer</person> was named Swiss sportsman of the year on Saturday, to add to the BBC overseas sportsman and European Sports Journalists Association awards he has already won.
