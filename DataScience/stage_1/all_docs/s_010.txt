Obikwelu</person> will also take part. <person>Collins</person> ran in
Birmingham at the 2003 World Indoor Championships. "I'm looking forward to
competing against such a strong field," he said. "I got a great reception form
the crowd at the NIA when I won my 60m world indoor silver medal in 2003 and it
will be really exciting to return to this venue." The world champion says he's
in good shape but he isn't underestimating the home competition. "<person>Jason
Gardener</person> and <person>Mark Lewis-Francis</person> are Olympic gold
medallists now and I'm sure they'll be aiming to win in front of their home
supporters. "I'm looking forward to competing against Britain's best sprinters
and I'm sure the 60 metres will be one of the most exciting races of the
evening." <person>Collins</person> was sixth in the Olympic final in Athens but
is hoping for a better result at the World Championships in Finland this
summer.  "This will be a big year for me and I plan to defend my 100m world
title in Helsinki in August. Before then I want to perform well over 60m
indoors and start my year in winning form."
