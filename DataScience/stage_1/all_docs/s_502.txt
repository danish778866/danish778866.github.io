Minister digs in over doping row

The Belgian sports minister at the centre of the <person>Svetlana Kuznetsova</person> doping row says he will not apologise for making allegations against her.

<person>Claude Eerdekens</person> claims the US Open champion tested positive for ephedrine at an exhibition event last month. Criticised for making the announcement, he said: "I will never apologise. This product is banned and it's up to her to explain why it's there." <person>Kuznetsova</person> says the stimulant may have been in a cold remedy she took. The Russian said she did nothing wrong by taking the medicine during the event. The Women's Tennis Association cleared <person>Kuznetsova</person> of any offence because the drug is not banned when taken out of competition.

<person>Eerdekens</person> said he made the statement in order to protect the other three players that took part in the tournament, Belgian <person>Justine Henin-Hardenne</person>, <person>Nathalie Dechy</person> of France and Russia's <person>Elena Dementieva</person>. But <person>Dechy</person> is fuming that she has been implicated in the row. "How can you be happy when you see your face on the cover page and talking about doping?" <person>Dechy</person> said. "I'm really upset about it and I think the Belgian government did a really bad job about this. "I think we deserve an apology from the guy. You cannot say anything like this - you cannot say some stuff like this, saying it's one of these girls. This is terrible." <person>Dementieva</person> is also angry and says that <person>Dechy</person> and herself are the real victims of the scandal. "You have no idea what I have been through all these days. It's been too hard on me," she said. "The WTA are trying to handle this problem by saying there are three victims, but I see only two victims in this story - me and <person>Nathalie Dechy</person>, who really have nothing to do with this. "To be honest with you, I don't feel like I want to talk to <person>Sveta</person> at all. I'm just very upset with the way everything has happened."
