"I'm delighted to have won against such a good opponent in a tournament of this importance," said <person>Soderling</person>. "I was really on form, my service was good and I really liked playing on the synthetic surface." <person>Soderling</person>, the world number 37, shrugged off a nervous start to take the opening set on his first set point. A change in approach from fourth seed <person>Stepanek</person> in the second set paid dividends as he took it on a tie-break, but <person>Soderling</person>'s superior power proved too much in the third.
