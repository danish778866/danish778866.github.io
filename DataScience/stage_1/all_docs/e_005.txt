Poppins musical gets flying start

The stage adaptation of children's film Mary Poppins has had its opening night in London's West End.

Sir <person>Cameron Mackintosh</person>'s lavish production, which has cost Â£9m to bring to the stage, was given a 10-minute standing ovation. Lead actress <person>Laura Michelle Kelly</person> soared over the heads of the audience holding the nanny's trademark umbrella. Technical hitches had prevented Mary Poppins' flight into the auditorium during preview performances. A number of celebrities turned out for the musical's premiere, including actress <person>Barbara Windsor</person>, comic <person>Graham Norton</person> and Sir <person>Richard Attenborough</person>.

The show's director <person>Richard Eyre</person> issued a warning earlier in the week that the show was unsuitable for children under seven, while under-threes are barred. Mary Poppins was originally created by author <person>Pamela Travers</person>, who is said to have cried when she saw Disney's 1964 film starring <person>Julie Andrews</person>. <person>Travers</person> had intended the story to be a lot darker than the perennial family favourite. Theatre impresario Sir <person>Cameron Mackintosh</person> has said he hopes the musical is a blend of the sweet-natured film and the original book.
