Scotland 18-10 Italy

Six <person>Chris Paterson</person> penalties gave Scotland victory in a dour but clinical encounter against Italy at Murrayfield.

Coach <person>Matt Williams</person>' side were outmuscled and outplayed in a tense first half but led 6-3 at the break. <person>Paterson</person> slotted four more second-half penalties and Scotland were denied a try when wing <person>Sean Lamont</person>'s touchdown was ruled out for a forward pass. A late <person>Andrea Masi</person> try was small consolation for Italy, chasing their first away win in the Six Nations. Scotland came out on top of the early exchanges and took a quick 3-0 lead through the boot of full-back <person>Paterson</person>. But the more powerful Azzurri pack eventually rumbled into life.

A series of drives into Scottish territory set up a penalty attempt, missed by full-back <person>Roland De Marigny</person>, and a wayward drop-goal effort from <person>Luciano Orquera</person>. Scotland defended the initial thrusts but on 20 minutes Italy, after coming up yards short of the line, equalised through a <person>De Marigny</person> penalty. Italy were offered another penalty when Scottish flanker <person>Simon Taylor</person> was offside but the left-footed <person>De Marigny</person> pushed his kick wide. Scotland finally made the most of a rare foray into the Italian half and snatched three points from <person>Paterson</person> when an Italian forward handled the ball in a ruck.

As the half wore on, both sides squandered promising spells of momentum with sloppy penalties, and the period fizzled out with Scotland numerically, if not psychologically, on top. Italy's <person>De Marigny</person> narrowly missed a chance to level the scores again shortly after the break but his long-range kick shaved the right upright. And Scotland capitalised with a third <person>Paterson</person> penalty on 50 minutes. <person>Williams</person>' side seemed to have found a spark from somewhere and, after a couple of probing attacks, <person>Paterson</person> was able to slot another three points to widen the gap.

With the pendulum of possession swinging towards Scotland, <person>Lamont</person> thought he had wriggled over in the left corner after 65 minutes but play was recalled for a marginal forward pass from <person>Paterson</person>. Another <person>Paterson</person> penalty on 70 minutes kept the pressure on the wilting visitors. But <person>John Kirwan</person>'s men had the last laugh when <person>Gordon Ross</person>' attempted clearance was charged down and <person>Masi</person> pounced for the try, converted by <person>De Marigny</person>.
