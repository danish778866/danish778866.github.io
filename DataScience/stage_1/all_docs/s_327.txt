<person>Sella</person> wants <person>Michalak</person> recall

Former France centre <person>Philippe Sella</person> believes coach <person>Bernard Laporte</person> must recall <person>Frederic Michalak</person> to give his side any chance of beating Ireland.

<person>Sella</person> admitted he had been impressed by current fly-half <person>Yann Delaigue</person> in the RBS Six Nations to date. But he told BBC Sport: "<person>Michalak</person> is the answer both now and for the future. <person>Delaigue</person> deserved his chance but the time has come to bring back <person>Michalak</person>. "He does have weaknesses but has the all-round game to upset Ireland." The 22-year-old <person>Michalak</person> has spent much of the tournament on the bench after <person>Delaigue</person> impressed for Castres early in the season. With <person>Michalak</person> overlooked, the French stuttered to narrow wins over Scotland and then England before ironically playing their best rugby in the defeat to Wales. "The Wales game was amazing to watch but never did I think the French could lose that game at half-time," said Sella.

"Their only mistakes were that they didn't score enough points in the first half and were a little bit less focused in the second... but only a little bit." <person>Sella</person>, however, insisted the pressure had eased on the under-fire <person>Laporte</person>, despite the defeat at the Stade de France. "This season is very important for shaping a team for the 2007 World Cup," said <person>Sella</person>, "which <person>Laporte</person> is doing very well. The French get better every game. "It's difficult, though, when you change a team and you change your tactics as everything has to gel. "But he has the players and the talent to take them all the way to World Cup victory. "As a result, it is important that people give him time. It may not seem good now that we're not winning the Grand Slam but no one will care in two years time if we're world champions."

The majority of media criticism centred on the way in which France produced a performance devoid of running rugby in their opening two games. But while <person>Sella</person> admitted he liked the more flowing style employed against Wales, he said "the win was most important". "Winning is all that matters," he added. "Ok, the flair may not have been so good, but the discipline, organisation and defence was there, which are all important ahead of 2007." France play what <person>Sella</person> believes is their hardest game of the Six Nations against Ireland in Dublin on Saturday 12 March. The French go into the game as clear underdogs. But <person>Sella</person> added: "People forget that France can still win the Six Nations and they'll be focused on that. "But Ireland will be going for even more in front of their home crowd. It's going to be tough."
