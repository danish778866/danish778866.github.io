<person>Dibaba</person> breaks 5,000m world record

Ethiopia's <person>Tirunesh Dibaba</person> set a new world record in winning
the women's 5,000m at the Boston Indoor Games.

<person>Dibaba</person> won in 14 minutes 32.93 seconds to erase the previous
world indoor mark of 14:39.29 set by another Ethiopian, <person>Berhane
Adera</person>, in Stuttgart last year.  But compatriot <person>Kenenisa
Bekele</person>'s record hopes were dashed when he miscounted his laps in the
men's 3,000m and staged his sprint finish a lap too soon.  Ireland's
<person>Alistair Cragg</person> won in 7:39.89 as <person>Bekele</person>
battled to second in 7:41.42.  "I didn't want to sit back and get out-kicked,"
said <person>Cragg</person>. "So I kept on the pace. The plan was to go with
500m to go no matter what, but when <person>Bekele</person> made the mistake
that was it. The race was mine." Sweden's <person>Carolina Kluft</person>, the
Olympic heptathlon champion, and Slovenia's <person>Jolanda Ceplak</person> had
winning performances, too. <person>Kluft</person> took the long jump at 6.63m,
while <person>Ceplak</person> easily won the women's 800m in 2:01.52.
