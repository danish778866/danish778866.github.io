<person>Michael Moore</person>'s anti-Bush documentary Fahrenheit 9/11 has won best film at the US People's Choice Awards, voted for by the US public.

<person>Mel Gibson</person>'s The Passion of the Christ won best drama, despite both films being snubbed so far at US film awards in the run-up to February's Oscars. <person>Julia Roberts</person> won her 10th consecutive crown as favourite female movie star. <person>Johnny Depp</person> was favourite male movie star and <person>Renee Zellweger</person> was favourite leading lady at Sunday's awards in LA.

Film sequel Shrek 2 took three prizes - voted top animated movie, top film comedy and top sequel. In television categories, Desperate Housewives was named top new drama and Joey, starring former Friends actor <person>Matt LeBlanc</person>, was best new comedy. Long-running shows Will and Grace and CSI: Crime Scene Investigation were named best TV comedy and TV drama respectively.

Nominees for the People's Choice Awards were picked by a 6,000-strong Entertainment Weekly magazine panel, and winners were subsequently chosen by 21 million online voters. Fahrenheit 9/11 director <person>Michael Moore</person> dedicated his trophy to soldiers in Iraq. His film was highly critical of President <person>George W Bush</person> and the US-led invasion of Iraq, and <person>Moore</person> was an outspoken <person>Bush</person> critic in the 2004 presidential campaign inwhich Democratic challenger <person>John Kerry</person> lost.

"This country is still all of ours, not right or left or Democrat or Republican," <person>Moore</person> told the audience at the ceremony in Pasadena, California. <person>Moore</person> said it was "an historic occasion" that the 31-year-old awards ceremony would name a documentary its best film. Unlike many other film-makers, Passion of the Christ director <person>Mel Gibson</person> has vowed not to campaign for an Oscar for his movie. "To me, really, this is the ultimate goal because one doesn't make work for the elite," <person>Gibson</person> said backstage at the event. "To me, the people have spoken."
