<person>Isinbayeva</person> claims new world best

Pole vaulter <person>Yelena Isinbayeva</person> broke her own indoor world
record by clearing
4.89 metres in Lievin on Saturday.

It was the Russian's 12th world record of her career and came just a few days
after she cleared 4.88m at the Norwich Union Grand Prix in Birmingham. The
Olympic champion went on to attempt 5.05m at the meeting on France but failed
to clear that height. In the men's 60m, former Olympic 100m champion
<person>Maurice Greene</person> could only finish second to <person>Leonard
Scott</person>. It was <person>Greene</person>'s second consecutive defeat at
the hands of his fellow American, who also won in Birmingham last week. "I ran
my race perfectly," said <person>Scott</person>, who won in
6.46secs, his best time indoors. "I am happy even if I know that
  <person>Maurice</person> is a long way from being at his peak at the start of
the season."
