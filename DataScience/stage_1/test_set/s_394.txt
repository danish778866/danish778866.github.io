"Before a final decision is made on surgery... medical teams have decided he should see a second specialist."

England coach <person>Andy Robinson</person> is already without centre <person>Will Greenwood</person> and flanker <person>Richard Hill</person> while fly-half <person>Jonny Wilkinson</person> is certain to miss at least the first two games. <person>Robinson</person> is expected to announce his new-look England line-up on Monday for the match at the Millennium Stadium. And Newcastle's 18-year-old centre <person>Mathew Tait</person> is set to stand in for <person>Tindall</person> alongside club team-mate <person>Jamie Noon</person>.
