Small Island, <person>Levy</person>'s fourth novel, is set in post-war England and centres on a landlady and her lodgers.

The judges, who included authors <person>Jenny Colgan</person> and <person>Amanda Craig</person>, were full of praise for her writing. "What could have been a didactic or preachy prospect turns out to hilarious, moving humane and eye-popping. It's hard to think of anybody not enjoying it," wrote the judges. The first novel section was won by <person>Susan Fletcher</person> for Eve Green, beating the favourite Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell by <person>Susanna Clarke</person>. <person>Fletcher</person> has recently graduated from graduated from the University of East Anglia creative writing course. Waterstone's fiction writer buyer <person>Suzie Doore</person> said: "It is great to see <person>Susan Fletcher</person> win in the first novel category. As a relatively unknown author this award will give her exposure to a wider and mass audience that she may not have reached and is a perfect example of the influence of the Whitbread. "Fresh out of university she is certainly one to watch."

In the biography category it was <person>John Guy</person>'s The Life of Mary Queen of Scots that was picked as winner. The judges called it "an impressive and readable piece of scholarship, which cannot fail but leave the reader moved and intrigued by this most tragic and likeable of queens". <person>Guy</person> has published many histories, including Tudor England. He is a fellow at Clare College, Cambridge and became a honorary research professor of the University of St Andrews in 2003. <person>Michael Symmons Roberts</person>' fourth collection of poems scooped the poetry award.
