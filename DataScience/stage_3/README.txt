1. We created four projects, i.e. group_16, group_16-2, group_16-3 and zagats_and_fodors in that order.
2. Our execution hung at finding potential matching step even though we completed each of the previous required steps.
3. We tried again in group_16-2 project, but it hung again.
4. We deleted the id column in both tables and tried again in project group_16-3 (since we were creating a fresh id anyway).
5. It worked. Finally we tried again without removing the id column in project zagats_and_fodors. It worked.
